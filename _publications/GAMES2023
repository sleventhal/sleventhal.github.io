The Girls at the Museum Exploring Science (GAMES) program, run out of the University of Colorado Museum
of Natural History for the last 20 years, is a community engagement program that aims to foster a positive
attitude towards science in elementary school-aged girls. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
in-person GAMES program has added remote sessions.

We use 5 years of survey data collected from program participants to gauge the impact that the GAMES program 
has on participant attitudes towards science and scientists. We partition these data into four groups based on 
instructional setting: in-person at school, in-person at University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, remote
from home, and remote from school. We find that the GAMES program increases the proportion of participants who 
can see themselves becoming scientists across all instructional types. Notably, the programs that take place outside 
of school settings (either in-person or remote) have greater positive impacts on participants than programs that take
place inside of schools. Additionally, participants across all groups use more technical language in their post-program
survey responses than in their pre-program responses, indicating increased comfort with scientific concepts. Remote
GAMES programs have more modest impacts on participant attitudes towards science and scientists, though a positive 
impact is still observable. This positive impact on participant attitudes towards science across all instructional groups
leads us to conclude that both in-person and remote instruction of the GAMES curriculum benefits children from underrepresented
groups in science. Remote instruction in particular has the ability to reach many more participants, specifically 
participants located in rural areas and/or areas with less direct access to science resources, and represents a 
promising avenue for future informal science education opportunities.
