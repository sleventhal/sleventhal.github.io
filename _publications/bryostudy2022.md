Cheilostome bryozoans are a diverse clade of colonial animals that first appeared during the Jurassic period.
 For the first 100 Myr of their existence, colonies of cheilostomes were monomorphic, composed entirely of autozooids. 
Divergent body types, termed avicularia, first appeared in colonies in the early Cretaceous period, in the genus  <i>Wilbertopora</i>. 
Over the course of the Cretaceous,  <i>Wilbertopora</i> diversified into 27 species, spanning the early Albian through Maastrichtian stages. 
In this study, we quantify autozooid and avicularia shape and size to evaluate how the morphological disparity of zooid types in 
colonies changes over the course of  <i>Wilbertopora</i> diversification. We find that taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity are 
largely decoupled, with disparity outpacing diversity for much of  <i>Wilbertopora</i>’s evolutionary history. Increases in disparity are 
primarily driven by evolution of avicularian morphology, indicating that  <i>Wilbertopora</i>’s avicularia may have served an array of purposes 
in different lineages.
