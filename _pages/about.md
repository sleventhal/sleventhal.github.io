Hi! I am Sarah Leventhal, a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder and a predoctoral fellow at the National Museum of Natural History. I am an invertebrate paleontologist interested in the evolution of colonial animals, particularly bryozoans! The robust fossil record of bryozoans makes them an excellent model system for the study of colony-level evolution. Furthermore, their calcified skeletons and clonal nature make them a great model system for the study of intracolonial variation on microevolutionary timescales.

Below are some of the big questions I'm interested in answering.

## How do traits in colonial animals evolve?

Bryozoans grow in modular colonies, meaning that every colony member ("zooid") is genetically identical. However, colonies express a wide range of phenotypic variation. I want to understand the evolution of colony-level traits, both in emergent features like division of labor (more on that below) and aggregate traits like phenotypic distributions of zooids.

Thus far in my research, I have found that aggregate traits, specifically the central tendency of colony-level phenotypic distributions, are evolvable. Furthermore, it turns out that the phenotypic variance in colonies is unstable in its evolutionary potential, meaning that it can shift drastically on relatively short timescales. This, in short, means that the evolution of aggregate traits in bryozoans is (for lack of a better word) chaotic.

In the future, I want to extend my study of aggregate traits to include traits of zooids that are non-feeding (meaning they serve other roles in the colony!). Additionally, I want to use fossils to see how aggregate traits behave on longer macroevolutionary timescales.



## How does division of labor evolve?

Some of the most exciting features of colonial animals are the divisions of labor found in colonies. Bryozoans exhibit this feature, sure, but so do many other colonial animals (think wasps, bees, ants, and siphonophores). Due to bryozoans' high-resolution fossil record, it is possible to reconstruct the evolutionary morphology of divergent body types in colonies. Such a reconstruction makes it possible to understand the evolutionary transitions leading up to complex differentiation in colonies, and, ultimately, will make it possible to understand how division of labor evolves.

Here is an example of division of labor in a 100 million-year old colony! The round oval (that's a zooid!) serves as a feeding member of the colony, and the pointy structure (another zooid!) may play some type of defensive role, though this is not entirely clear.
