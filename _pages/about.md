Hi! I'm Sarah Leventhal, a paleobiologist interested in the evolution of colonial animals. I use cheilostome bryozoans as a study system to investigate the origination and proliferation of complex colony-level traits, with a specific emphasis on division of labor.

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.

## Macroevolution of complex colony-level traits

What role does heritable variation play in the evolution of group-level traits?
 
The evolution of group-level traits is difficult to study, especially on macroevolutionary timescales. Modular animals like bryozoans grow in clonal sessile colonies that are often calcified, allowing them to readily preserve after death. These features make them a good study system for investigating the evolution of group-level traits. I am interested in understanding the evolution of colony-level traits, both in emergent features like division of labor (more on that below) and aggregate traits like distributions of individual-level phenotypes in colonies.

## The evolutionary morphology of division of labor

What processes shaped the wide array of forms and functions we see across organisms today?

Division of labor appears as polymorphism Some colonial Bryozoans exhibit this feature, as do many other colonial animals (think wasps, bees, ants, and siphonophores). Due to bryozoans' high-resolution fossil record, it is possible to reconstruct the evolution of divergent body types in colonies. Such a reconstruction makes it possible to understand the evolutionary transitions leading up to complex differentiation in colonies, and, ultimately, will make it possible to understand how division of labor evolves.

Here is an example of division of labor in a 100 million-year old colony. The round oval (an autozooid) serves as a feeding member of the colony, and the pointed oval (an avicularium) seems to play a defensive role. In extant colonies, these polymorphs serve defensive functions like snagging the limbs of arthropod predators.

## Informal education as science communication

Can informal education programs improve public interest in science as a discipline?

Scientific literacy is in crsis across the United States, despite the country's high level of educational attainment. I am interested in understanding the role that informal science education programs may play in encouraging people to view science as a discipline worthy of extracurricular interest.
