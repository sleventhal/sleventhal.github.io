Hi! I am Sarah Leventhal, a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder and a predoctoral fellow at the National Museum of Natural History. I am an invertebrate paleontologist interested in the evolution of colonial animals, particularly bryozoans! The robust fossil record of bryozoans makes them an excellent model system for the study of colony-level evolution. Furthermore, their calcified skeletons and clonal nature make them a great model system for the study of intracolonial variation on microevolutionary timescales.

I also have a broad interest in the use of informal science education as a teaching tool for school-age students. Since I am based out of a university museum, I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing programs that aim to teach children to love science in a positive, relaxed environment! I think the disconnect between scientists and the broader public can be addressed by encouraging people to view science in a positive, empowering light.

Below are some of the big topics I want to understand.

## Complex trait evolution

What role does heritable variation play in the evolution of group-level traits?
 
The evolution of group-level traits is difficult to study, especially on macroevolutionary timescales. Modular animals like bryozoans grow in clonal sessile colonies that are often calcified, allowing them to readily preserve after death. These features make them a model system for studying how group-level traits evolve. I am interested in understanding the evolution of colony-level traits, both in emergent features like division of labor (more on that below) and aggregate traits like trait distributions of individuals in colonies.

Thus far in my research, I have found that aggregate traits, specifically the central tendency of colony-level phenotypic distributions, are evolvable. Furthermore, it turns out that the phenotypic variance in colonies is unstable in its evolutionary potential, meaning that it can shift drastically on relatively short timescales. This, in short, means that the evolution of aggregate traits in bryozoans is (for lack of a better word) chaotic.



## The evolutionary morphology of division of labor

What processes shaped the wide array of forms and functions we see across organisms today?

Some of the most exciting features of colonial animals are the divisions of labor found in colonies. Bryozoans exhibit this feature, sure, but so do many other colonial animals (think wasps, bees, ants, and siphonophores). Due to bryozoans' high-resolution fossil record, it is possible to reconstruct the evolution of divergent body types in colonies. Such a reconstruction makes it possible to understand the evolutionary transitions leading up to complex differentiation in colonies, and, ultimately, will make it possible to understand how division of labor evolves.

Here is an example of division of labor in a 100 million-year old colony! The round oval (that's an autozooid!) serves as a feeding member of the colony, and the pointy structure (called an avicularium) may play some type of defensive role, though this is not entirely clear.

Speaking more broadly, I want to understand how division of labor occurs as an evolutionary transition in all living systems.


## Informal education as science communication

Scientific literacy is remarkably low across the United States, despite the country's high level of educational attainment. While the causes of scientific illiteracy are mulitifaceted, part of this issue stems from a general public disinterest in science as a discipline. I am interested in understanding the role that informal science education programs may play in encouraging people, especially children, to view science as a discipline worthy of extracurricular interest.

Since 2021, I have been working with the Girls at the Museum Exploring Science (<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cumuseum/content/girls-museum-exploring-science-games-program"> GAMES </a>) program, based out of the University of Colorado's Museum of Natural History (CUMNH), to address this topic. GAMES is a program intended to encourage school-aged girls to see themselves as future professional scientists or citizen scientists. Through this program, students are able to participate in hands-on activities in museum-based disciplines, like paleontology or archeology. They are able to meet with faculty at the University of Colorado Boulder, and ask them questions about their work. This program is a decade old, so there is a wealth of data from anonymous surveys collected pre- and posts-program from years past. This provides indispensible insight into the impact that the program, and its different implementations, has on student attitudes towards science and scientists.

Stay tuned for publication of the full study on the impacts this program has had on students, and the various novel content pieces that are currently in development!
