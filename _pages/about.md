Hi! I am Sarah Leventhal, a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am an invertebrate paleontologist interested in the evolution of modular animals, particularly bryozoans!


I am currently completing a predoctoral fellowship at the National Museum of Natural History in Washignton, D.C., where I am investigating how division of labor in early colonies of cheilostome bryozoans evolved.
