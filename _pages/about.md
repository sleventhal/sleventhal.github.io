Hi! I am Sarah Leventhal, a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder and a predoctoral fellow at the National Museum of Natural History. I am an invertebrate paleontologist interested in the evolution of colonial animals, particularly bryozoans! The robust fossil record of bryozoans makes them an excellent model system for the study of colony-level evolution. Furthermore, their calcified skeletons and clonal nature make them a great model system for the study of intracolonial variation on microevolutionary timescales.

Below are some of the big topics I want to understand.

## Complex trait evolution

What role does heritable variation play in the evolution of group-level traits?
 
The evolution of group-level traits is difficult to study, especially on macroevolutionary timescales. Modular animals like bryozoans grow in clonal sessile colonies that are often calcified, allowing them to readily preserve after death. These features make them a model system for studying how group-level traits evolve. I am interested in understanding the evolution of colony-level traits, both in emergent features like division of labor (more on that below) and aggregate traits like trait distributions of individuals in colonies.

Thus far in my research, I have found that aggregate traits, specifically the central tendency of colony-level phenotypic distributions, are evolvable. Furthermore, it turns out that the phenotypic variance in colonies is unstable in its evolutionary potential, meaning that it can shift drastically on relatively short timescales. This, in short, means that the evolution of aggregate traits in bryozoans is (for lack of a better word) chaotic.



## The evolutionary morphology of division of labor

What processes shaped the wide array of forms and functions we see across organisms today?

Some of the most exciting features of colonial animals are the divisions of labor found in colonies. Bryozoans exhibit this feature, sure, but so do many other colonial animals (think wasps, bees, ants, and siphonophores). Due to bryozoans' high-resolution fossil record, it is possible to reconstruct the evolution of divergent body types in colonies. Such a reconstruction makes it possible to understand the evolutionary transitions leading up to complex differentiation in colonies, and, ultimately, will make it possible to understand how division of labor evolves.

Here is an example of division of labor in a 100 million-year old colony! The round oval (that's an autozooid!) serves as a feeding member of the colony, and the pointy structure (called an avicularium) may play some type of defensive role, though this is not entirely clear.

Speaking more broadly, I want to understand how division of labor occurs as an evolutionary transition in all living systems.
