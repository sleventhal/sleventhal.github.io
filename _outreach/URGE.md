As a co-leader of CU Boulder's URGE pod, I work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policy in the university community.
URGE operates as a policy-focused group. We evaluate existing university policy and provide recommendations to our department leadership
based on data-driven DEI initiatives.
