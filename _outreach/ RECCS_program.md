The RECCS program is an excellent opportunity for community college students to get hands-on research experience (and a stipend!) at CU Boulder!
I served as a mentor for this program in the Summer of 2021, and I plan to continue working with the RECCS program to mentor students in
the future. The program works by matching a graduate student or faculty mentor with an interested community college student from Colorado.
Then, for nine weeks, the mentor and mentee work together to complete a research project.
