Since Fall of 2022, I have served as a mentor for the GEMS program. GEMS is designed to match geology-curious 
undergraduates with graduate student mentors (that's me!).

The role of a GEMS mentor is to provide support for 
undergraduate applicants to graduate school programs, internships, fellowships, and research grants. I love learning
about the interests of the undergraduate students I mentor, and I am passionate about helping them achieve their goals!
