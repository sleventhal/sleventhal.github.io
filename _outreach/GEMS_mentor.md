Since Fall of 2022, I have served as a mentor for the <a href="https://urgeoscience.org/"> GEMS program </a>. GEMS is designed to match geology-curious 
undergraduates with graduate student mentors (that's me!).

The role of a GEMS mentor is to provide support for undergraduate applicants to internships, fellowships, graduate school applications, and research grants. I love learning about the interests of the undergraduate students I mentor, and I am passionate about helping them achieve their goals!
