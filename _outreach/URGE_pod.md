Unlearning Racism in the Geosciences (URGE) is a program designed to address ongoing problems of inequity in academia. As a co-leader of CU Boulder's URGE pod, I work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policy in the university community. URGE is a URGE operates as a policy-focused group. We evaluate existing university policy and provide recommendations to our department leadership based on data-driven DEI initiatives.

In conjunction with our department's DEI faculty committee, our pod has achieved several initiatives, including the waiving of student fees for incoming studnets, the establishment of research grants specifically for BIPOC students, and the introduction of several anti-bias workshops for students and faculty. While our URGE pod's work is far from complete, we have used the URGE curriculum to push our department in the right direction.
