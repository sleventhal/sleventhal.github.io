As a co-leader of CU Boulder's URGE pod, I work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policy in the university community.
URGE operates as a policy-focused group. We evaluate existing university policy and provide recommendations to our department leadership
based on data-driven DEI initiatives.

In conjunction with our department's DEI faculty committee, our pod has achieved several initiatives, including the waiving of student fees for incoming studnets, the establishment of BIPOC-exclusive research grants, and the introduction of several anti-bias workshops for students and faculty. While our URGE pod's work is far from complete, we have used the URGE curriculum to push our department in the right direction.
