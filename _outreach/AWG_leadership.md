I served as a member of the outreach committee for AWG's Laramide Chapter from December 2020 to September 2022. In this position, I helped coordinate the annual "Outstanding Student Awards" reception and served as an AWG representative at several science fairs, including the CoorsTek Denver Metro Regional Science and Engineering Fair, the Wyoming State Science Fair, and the Northeastern Regional Science and Engineering Fair. As a judge at these fairs, I selected the winner of the AWG Student Award for Geoscience Excellence (SAGE).
