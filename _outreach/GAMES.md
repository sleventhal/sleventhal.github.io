I serve as an organizer and instructor for the CU Museum's Girls and the Museum Exploring Science (GAMES) program. This program encourages
girls in primary school to foster an appreciation for science. We teach students about ongoing research at the University museum and give
them the opportunity to take part in hands-on research-based activities.
