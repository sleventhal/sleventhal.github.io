Bryozoans colonies grow by asexual propagation of
members (“zooids”) within a colony. Previous studies
of the cheilostome bryozoan Stylopoma have shown
that there is a wide range of morphological variation
of zooids within in a colony. This pattern limits the
amount of evolution that occurs within a colony, since
phenotypic changes don’t accumulate. But different
Stylopoma species are morphometrically distinct,
showing that even though these same attributes cannot evolve within colonies, they can and have evolved
across different species. Therefore, the pattern of
evolution within colonies must be screened off from
the pattern of evolution between species. To study this
evolutionary process, I test the idea that the degree of
plasticity of morphology within a colony is evolving
rather than individual phenotypes of zooids within in
a colony. Using Stylopoma colonies bred in a common
garden breeding experiment, I measure the heritability of phenotypic plasticity between colonies.
